          Hello, Internet. My name is Thomas "RampantEpsilon" Ware. I'm a computer nerd, geek, etc. by nature and love working on and with computers. I've had years of experience in computer systems and repairs dealing with viruses, missing/damaged settings, and hardware/software issues.
          <br><br>Recently, I've completed my Associate's in Computer Science and am working on my Bachelor's in Computer Science through Grantham University. During my time, I've learned how to code in Java, Python, C++, and C#.NET. I've also expanded upon my previous knowledge of HTML and CSS by learning how to incorporate Javascript and JQuery into more of my projects. Since around November 2018, I've expanded my knowledge further by learning Electron which is a way to utilize websites in an application environment. With that, I've completed two projects with several more in early thought processes.
          <br><br>
          For a list of all of my projects, visit the link <a class='link' onclick='redirect("./projects")'>HERE</a>.
